# Compare-Sheets
IMPORTANT:  In Order to get the code running you need to create or link a folder where two sheets can be temporarily be saved. 
You can set this up in the module "constant".

This Excel sheet compares two Excel sheets. It marks the deviations between the two in different colors depending on the type of difference.
After you uploaded both Excel workbooks you want to compare, you can select the sheets of the workbook, which you want to compare.
Two temporary copies of the sheets are created and opened and the deviations are marked in the second temporary file.
You can save the temporary file with the marked deviations.
In settings, you can choose the colors of the deviation types.
